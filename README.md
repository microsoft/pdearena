While this repository contains code to accompany the paper: **Towards multi-spatiotemporal-scale generalized PDE modeling**, we hope this can be a starting point for future PDE surrogate learning research. 
We will soon have models from **Clifford neural layers for PDE modeling** as well. 

For details about usage please see [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/pdearena). 
If you have any questions or suggestions please open a [discussion](). If you notice a bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/pdearena/issues).
